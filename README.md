# Lidar-Room-Scanner-with-Music
This is a project I am working on where it uses multiple 2D lidar sensors to make a 3D image of a room and then sends it to your phone in a form that you can view. It will also be able to connect to a speaker set up that makes it so you have the perfect volume depending on where you are. It will use servos to tilt the sensors.
